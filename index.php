			<p><a href="http://jazzleeds.org.uk" target="_blank">Jazz Leeds</a> have received a donation of over 300 books about Jazz from the
			collection of the late Bill Sheldrake. These books are available for individual sale on a Pay As You Feel basis to anyone who has
			an interest in purchasing them.</p>
			<p>As there are far too many books to bring along to gigs for people to peruse, this site has been set up so that
			anyone interested can flag which books they may be interested in, and which gigs they will be attending, so that
			we can try to get the books to them.</p>
			<p>Please note that any information asked for on this site is used purely for the purpose of getting the books you
			may be interested in to the gigs you are going to, and no other purpose. For example, if you enter an email address it will not
			even be added to the Jazz Leeds mailing list. Any money paid for the books goes into Jazz Leeds funds (in the same way
			that the raffle money does).</p>
			<p>To get started, click on <a href="booklist.php">Book List</a>. This will show a searchable table with the books listed,
			and let you tick which ones you are interested in. Then the <a href="interested.php">Interested List Page</a> lets you
			enter your (minimal) details and sends them in an email to us. See the <a href="help.php" target="_blank">Help Page</a> for
			more information.</p>

			<p>Bill had 2 loves in his life - his family and listening to music - in particular Jazz.</p>
			<p>An only child, he loved to solve puzzles and read, often having several books on the go at once.</p>
			<p>He met his wife Audrey whilst they were both in the army. They spent their first 12 years together
			in Kenya, and several places in Germany before settling down in Kent with their 4 children.</p>
			<p>He was a humble, hard working man, who did everything he could to provide a good home for his
			wife and family. He lost Audrey in 1997, and at this point, also bringing up 2 grandchildren,
			he found great solace listening to music.</p>
			<p>He spent many years campaigning on behalf of Mental Health users and carers, having spent
			many years as a carer for 2 of his children who have complex Mental Health needs, and during
			this time he built up an extensive library of books, especially books on Jazz. He devoured as
			much information as he could, read as many biographies/autobiographies as he could and collected
			many pictorial history music books.</p>
			<p>He felt very lucky to meet Maggie during his later years,
			and they spent 6 happy years together, sharing a love of music and travelling - he was absolutely
			thrilled to see George Melly several times and also to go to Ronnie Scott's and celebrate his
			75th Birthday - before he passed away in 2011.</p>
			<p>It means a great deal to me, his daughter, as it would to Bill, that other people will now
			be able to share in the enjoyment that he found in his collection of Jazz books.</p>
