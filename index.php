			<p>Bill had 2 loves in his life - his family and listening to music - in particular Jazz.</p>
			<p>An only child, he loved to solve puzzles and read, often having several books on the go at once.</p>
			<p>He met his wife Audrey whilst they were both in the army. They spent their first 12 years together
			in Kenya, and several places in Germany before settling down in Kent with their 4 children.</p>
			<p>He was a humble, hard working man, who did everything he could to provide a good home for his
			wife and family. He lost Audrey in 1997, and at this point, also bringing up 2 grandchildren,
			he found great solace listening to music.</p>
			<p>He spent many years campaigning on behalf of Mental Health users and carers, having spent
			many years as a carer for 2 of his children who have complex Mental Health needs, and during
			this time he built up an extensive library of books, especially books on Jazz. He devoured as
			much information as he could, read as many biographies/autobiographies as he could and collected
			many pictorial history music books.</p>
			<p>He felt very lucky to meet Maggie during his later years,
			and they spent 6 happy years together, sharing a love of music and travelling - he was absolutely
			thrilled to see George Melly several times and also to go to Ronnie Scott's and celebrate his
			75th Birthday - before he passed away in 2011.</p>
			<p>It means a great deal to me, his daughter, as it would to Bill, that other people will now
			be able to share in the enjoyment that he found in his collection of Jazz books.</p>
