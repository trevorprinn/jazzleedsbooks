		<p>The <a href="booklist.php">Book List page</a> allows you to browse a list of the books that we
		have available. There are far too many books for us to bring them all along to every gig, so
		if you are interested in seeing or buying any of them you will need to let us know which ones you
		are interested in, and which gigs you will be going to.</p>
		
		<p>Initially, you will just see a page of the first 10 books (in alphabetical order by title). You can:
		<ul>
		<li>View other pages by clicking on the Previous/Next or page number links at the bottom right.</li>
		<li>Change the number of books displayed per page by changing the "Show xx entries" drop down at
		the top left.</li>
		<li>Change the order of the list by clicking on one of the column headers.</li>
		<li>Search for books by an author or with a particular word in the title by typing into
		the Search box at the top right.</li>
		<li>Show the book covers, where available, by ticking the box above the list.</li> 
		</ul></p>
		
		<p>When you see a book that you are interested in, tick the box in the "Interested" column.</p>
		
		<p>Once you have ticked the books you want, click on "Interested List" (either at the top of the page,
		or the button at the bottom).</p>

		<p>The <a href="interested.php">Interested List page</a> shows a list of the books you have selected
		at the top. If you change your mind about any, you can remove them from the list by clicking the Remove button.
		You can also return to the Book List page to add or remove any books from your list.</p>
		
		<p>Once you have the list you want, you can scroll down and tick the gigs you are going to,
		so we can arrange to get the books there. It's best to give us at least a few days, as we will
		need to find the books, which may be in storage, and get them to someone who will be running
		the gig.</p>
		
		<p>Below that, you must enter your name. You can also enter an email address, useful if we need
		to clarify anything, and any other notes you want to send us.</p>
		
		<p>You can't press the Send Email button until you have entered the minimum amount of information, which
		is that you must have selected some books and gigs, and entered your name. Once you press the Send Email
		button an email is automatically sent to us with the details you have entered (and nothing else).</p>
		
		<p><strong>Selecting some books and sending an email does not commit you to anything.</strong>
		It just lets us know that you are interested in having a look at the books, and you can choose
		to buy them or not when you have seen them, and you can pay whatever you think they are worth to you.</p>
		
		<p>Any money you pay goes into Jazz Leeds funds, same as the raffle money.</p>

		<p>The list of books is not actually stored on this site, but on another site called
		<a href="http://www.librarything.com">LibraryThing</a>. This can be used to create a catalogue
		of books, either for an individual or a small library. By using the LibraryThing link in the header
		you can browse the list on that site. There may be more covers available that way, and you can see more
		details about the books.</p>
		
		<p>Using LibraryThing, together with their <a href="http://www.librarything.com/more/store/cuecat" target="_blank">CueCat barcode scanner</a>, allowed us to create the
		catalogue very quickly.</p>
